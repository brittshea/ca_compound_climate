Introduction: We examined 3 county-daily-level climate hazards - anomalously warm temperatures, wildfire disasters, and long power outages during 2018-2019.

Data: 
1. Wildfire disasters were those that burned 1+ structures, killed a civilian, or received a FEMA Fire
Management Declaration, and that overlapped with a community (population density of ≥ 250
people/km2) (29,30). We defined a county-day as exposed to a wildfire disaster when a wildfire
was burning (i.e., the day fell between ignition and containment date), and the wildfire burn zone
boundary overlapped spatially with the county perimeter. We identified wildfire disasters using data from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

2. To define county-days with an anomalously warm ambient temperature, we identified county-days
with daily average temperatures > 24°C and ≥ 85th percentile of the weekly long-term
county average (1981–2010). We used temperature data from Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) by PRISM Climate group Oregon State that Dr. Robbie M. Parks converted to daily county FIPS, ZIP Code, and census tract summaries for use in several papers.

3. To identify county-days with long power outages, we identified outages that lasted for 8+ hours while affecting > 0.5% of county customers using PowerOutage.us data.
